I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate from the College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore. My research interests include computer vision, machine learning, computer graphics, vision-language models, and large language models.

I am advised by [Prof. Lee Tong Heng](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/lee-tong-heng/) and [Prof. Abdullah Al Mamun](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/abdullah-al-mamun/). I am very fortunate to work closely with [Dr. Haiyue Zhu](https://research.a-star.edu.sg/researcher/haiyue-zhu/) from SIMTech, A*Star.

Before joining NUS, I obtained my B.S. degree from the School of Physics, Harbin Institute of Technology.

My Resume can be accessed here: [Résumé_Jiahui_Wang](../files/Résumé_Jiahui_Wang.pdf).
